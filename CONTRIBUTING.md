# How to contribute
The repository hosts an internal project of Norispace. Only allowed members can
contribute. This project follows main and feature branch scheme to accept
contributions. The procedure is following

1. Create a new feature branch

2. Make changes and commit them

3. File a pull request (PR)


Note that forking is omitted unlike the common procedure to contribute to open-source
software because this project is not a public repo yet. Contributors are free to create
and push a new branch to this remote for easy iteration of review process.

- Respect commit title and body convention

    In title, try 50 chars in English and use verb first in the imperative. Writing body
    is higly encouraged. Explain what you did in plain language. Body can be written in
    Korean.

- Check and remove whitespaces

    Use your editor or IDE to clear whitespaces. Or use a tool like
    [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/).

- Review what you are committing

    Avoid committing large files by mistakes. Feel free to update `.gitignore` file.



## How to open a PR
For the moment, it is not required to file an issue for a PR. Make a PR whenever you
feel suited. There is no template nor tag. Choose a concise title that represents your
PR well and describe the changes in the body.
